# mdLens — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
macOS native markdown viewer built with SwiftUI + WKWebView + swift-markdown.
SwiftPM project (no Xcode project file).

## ▶ Active Project — Slack 👀 ingestion (see PLAN.md)
Integrating a verified Slack daemon into mdLens so reacting 👀 on a Slack `.html`/`.md`
opens it in mdLens. **PLAN.md is the SSOT.** Verified daemon source to port lives in
`_slack_integration/slackhtml-src/` (gitignored staging). Key facts:
- Add `.html` viewing + an **opt-in** MenuBarExtra Socket Mode listener (no tokens → stays a pure viewer).
- Tokens in **Keychain** (never embedded). Signing identity `Developer ID Application: Sugarscone (5FK7UUGMX3)` makes Keychain ACL prompt-free.
- ⚠️ **Never use `pkill -f <pat>`** — it matches and kills the executing shell. Kill only recorded PIDs.
- Work on **`dev`** branch per AGENTS.md; PR to `main`.

## Build & Run

```bash
# Debug build
swift build

# Release build
swift build -c release

# Run locally (copy binary into app bundle)
cp .build/release/mdLens mdLens.app/Contents/MacOS/mdLens
open mdLens.app
```

## Release & Auto-update
Tag format is `build-<7-char-hash>` (no semver). See `README.md` for the full install,
release, and auto-update flow — it's the authoritative doc. Do not duplicate details here.

Key invariants agents must preserve:
- `swift build` alone produces an ad-hoc signed binary with `BuildInfo.commitHash == "dev"` — auto-update stays disabled.
- `scripts/build-release.sh` is the only path that injects a real hash + Developer ID signs + notarizes.
- Never hand-edit `CFBundleShortVersionString`; the script sets it from `git HEAD`.

## Architecture

### App Structure
- **DocumentGroup(viewing: MarkdownFileDocument.self)** — read-only document app. Each open
  file gets its own window/scene with independent state; there is **no shared app-wide document
  singleton**. Opening N files (Finder multi-select, drag-to-Dock) yields N windows.
- `MarkdownFileDocument` (FileDocument) holds the loaded text; the on-disk URL comes from
  `FileDocumentConfiguration.fileURL` (needed for relative-image baseURL).
- `AppSettings` (@Observable, single shared instance, UserDefaults-backed) holds cross-window
  prefs (theme, fontSize). Injected via `.environment`.
- Per-window menu actions (Reload) flow through `.focusedSceneValue` → `@FocusedValue` so the
  command targets the frontmost document window.

### Rendering Pipeline (MarkdownRenderer.swift)
1. Front matter extraction → styled HTML card
2. Link destination preprocessing (encode spaces for CommonMark)
3. Emoji shortcode conversion (single-pass regex)
4. Footnote definition extraction
5. swift-markdown AST parsing → HTMLVisitor
6. Post-process: footnote refs, admonitions
7. Wrap in full HTML with CSS + scripts

### Key Design Decisions
- **loadFileURL** instead of loadHTMLString: WKWebView needs file:// access for local images
- Image paths resolved to absolute `file://` URLs in HTMLVisitor; link hrefs likewise
  resolved in `visitLink` (relative→doc dir, absolute `/` & `~` direct, `#`/http/mailto kept)
- Link clicks routed by `WebViewRepresentable`'s `WKNavigationDelegate`: `.md` files open in
  a new window (open-with-this-app → DocumentGroup), other files/web URLs open externally,
  same-document `#anchors` scroll
- Temp HTML written per-window to `/tmp/mdlens/preview-<uuid>.html`, `allowingReadAccessTo: /` (UUID avoids multi-window clobber)
- Dangerous HTML tags (script, iframe, etc.) sanitized in visitHTMLBlock/visitInlineHTML

### Shared Utilities (String+Extensions.swift)
- `extractPlainText(from:)` — recursive AST plain text extraction
- `SlugGenerator` — heading ID generation (used by HTMLVisitor for heading anchors)
- `markdownExtensions` — `Set<String>` of recognized extensions
- `String.htmlEscaped` — HTML entity escaping
- `String.slugified` — heading text → URL-safe slug

## Conventions
- All regexes cached as `static let` (no runtime compilation per render)
- UserDefaults keys as `static let` constants (e.g. on `AppSettings`)
- No shared mutable app state across windows; document state lives per-scene via DocumentGroup
